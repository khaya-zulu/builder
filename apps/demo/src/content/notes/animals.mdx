# From Burnout to Breakthrough: How I Rediscovered Joy in Side Projects 🚴‍♂️

For a while, I hit a wall. Building software felt like a chore. The joy I once had for side projects had disappeared into backlogs, sprint deadlines, and endless Zoom calls.

But one weekend changed everything.

## The Problem: When Passion Becomes Pressure

I used to spend evenings experimenting — building random things like a weather app that shouted forecasts in pirate speak. But slowly, side projects turned into "portfolio pieces," then into expectations.

> _“Will this get me a job?”_ > _“Is this scalable?”_ > _“Should I add tests now or after MVP?”_

These questions crushed my creativity. I stopped building for fun.

## The Shift: Build for Yourself

Everything changed on a Saturday morning when I read this tweet from [@levelsio](https://twitter.com/levelsio):

> _“The best ideas come when you're building what you need.”_

That hit. Hard.

So I asked myself:

- What problem do **I** have?
- What do **I** want to play with?
- What if it’s just… fun?

## The Project: Ride Logger

I'm an amateur cyclist. I track rides with my phone, but I always wanted a minimalist ride logger that just saved:

- Time
- Distance
- Mood

So I built it. No auth. No backend. Just a local PWA that stores data in `localStorage`.

### A Peek into the Code

```js
const saveRide = (ride) => {
  const existing = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("rides")) || [];
  existing.push(ride);
  localStorage.setItem("rides", JSON.stringify(existing));
};
```
